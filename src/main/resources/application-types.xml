It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of 170,000 pounds (77,000 kg). Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). Three missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo command and service module (Apollo CSM), launched by the smaller Saturn IB rocket.

They went on to state that the telemetry link with Tiangong-1 had been lost. A couple of months later, amateur satellite trackers watching Tiangong-1 found that China's space agency had lost control of the station. In September, after conceding they had lost control over the station, officials speculated that the station would re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere late in 2017.

Salyut 6 possessed several revolutionary advances over the earlier Soviet space stations, which it nevertheless resembled in overall design. These included the addition of a second docking port, a new main propulsion system and the station's primary scientific instrument, the BST-1M multispectral telescope. The addition of the second docking port made crew handovers and station resupply by unmanned Progress freighters possible for the first time.\\\",\\\"orbit\\\":\\\"Low Earth Orbit\\\",\\\"owners\\\":[{\\\"id\\\":63,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/ll.thespacedevs.com\\/2.2.0\\/agencies\\/63\\/?format=json\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)\\\",\\\"abbrev\\\":\\\"RFSA\\\"}],\\\"image_url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\\/media\\/spacestation_images\\/salyut25206_image_20190318095930.jpg\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":10,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/ll.thespacedevs.com\\/2.2.0\\/spacestation\\/10\\/?format=json\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Salyut 2\\\",\\\"status\\\":{\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"De-Orbited\\\"},\\\"type\\\":{\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Government\\\"},\\\"founded\\\":\\\"1973-04-03\\\",\\\"deorbited\\\":\\\"1973-05-28\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Salyut 2 (OPS-1) (Russian: \u0421\u0430\u043B\u044E\u0442-2 meaning Salute 2) was a Soviet space station which was launched in 1973 as part of the Salyut programme.

It was launched unmanned by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of 170,000 pounds (77,000 kg). Lifting Skylab into low earth orbit was the final mission and launch of a Saturn V rocket (famous for carrying the manned Moon landing missions). Three missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo command and service module (Apollo CSM), launched by the smaller Saturn IB rocket. For the final two manned missions to Skylab, a backup Apollo CSM\\/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready in case an in-orbit rescue mission was needed, but this backup vehicle was never flown.\\\",\\\"orbit\\\":\\\"Low Earth Orbit\\\",\\\"owners\\\":[{\\\"id\\\":44,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/ll.thespacedevs.com\\/2.2.0\\/agencies\\/44\\/?format=json\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\\",\\\"abbrev\\\":\\\"NASA\\\"}],\\\"image_url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\\/media\\/spacestation_images\\/skylab_image_20190215230143.jpeg\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":7,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/ll.thespacedevs.com\\/2.2.0\\/spacestation\\/7\\/?format=json\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Tiangong 1\\\",\\\"status\\\":{\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"De-Orbited\\\"},\\\"type\\\":{\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Government\\\"},\\\"founded\\\":\\\"2011-09-29\\\",\\\"deorbited\\\":\\\"2018-04-02\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Tiangong-1 (Chinese: \u5929\u5BAB\u4E00\u53F7; pinyin: Ti\u0101ng\u014Dng y\u012Bh\u00E0o; literally: \\\\\\\"Heavenly Palace 1\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Celestial Palace 1\\\\\\\") was China's first prototype space station.

A third and final mission to Tiangong-1, the manned Shenzhou 10, docked in June 2013. The manned missions to Tiangong-1 were notable for including China's first female astronauts, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nOn 21 March 2016, after a lifespan extended by two years, the China Manned Space Engineering Office announced that Tiangong-1 had officially ended its service. They went on to state that the telemetry link with Tiangong-1 had been lost. A couple of months later, amateur satellite trackers watching Tiangong-1 found that China's space agency had lost control of the station. In September, after conceding they had lost control over the station, officials speculated that the station would re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere late in 2017. According to the China Manned Space Engineering Office, Tiangong-1 started reentry over the southern Pacific Ocean, northwest of Tahiti, on 2 April 2018 at 00:15 UTC.\\\",\\\"orbit\\\":\\\"Low Earth Orbit\\\",\\\"owners\\\":[{\\\"id\\\":17,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/ll.thespacedevs.com\\/2.2.0\\/agencies\\/17\\/?format=json\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"China National Space Administration\\\",\\\"abbrev\\\":\\\"CNSA\\\"}],\\\"image_url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\\/media\\/spacestation_images\\/tiangong25201_image_20190215013038.jpeg\\\"},{\\\"id\\\":5,\\\"url\\\":\\\"https:\\/\\/ll.thespacedevs.com\\/2.2.0\\/spacestation\\/5\\/?format=json\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Mir\\\",\\\"status\\\":{\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"De-Orbited\\\"},\\\"type\\\":{\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Government\\\"},\\\"founded\\\":\\\"1986-02-20\\\",\\\"deorbited\\\":\\\"2001-03-23\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Mir was a space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001, operated by the Soviet Union and later by Russia.

It had an interior floor area of 34.8 sq. The pitch of the station was 2 X 59 N, yaw was 2 X 59 N and roll was 2 X 20 N. The electric System produced an average of 2.00 kW of power. It had 2,000 kg of scientific equipment alongside two sets of three solar panels each and was equipped with the Delta Navigation System which was a new autonomous navigation system that calculates orbital elements without assistance from ground.
